/*

ðŸ”¹ Condition to be a Judge : if a person has trust of all people and he trusts no one
So, we consider, in a Graph
outdegree : giving trust to someone
indegree : having trust of someone

ðŸ”¸ if a person has trust of all people and he trusts no one
as, for outdegree, we are Subtarcting the value, so if anyone has outdegree > 0, it can never be equal to n - 1 and hence not a Judge

ðŸ”¹So, our equation becomes, indegree + outdgree == n - 1
here, outdegree should be 0, and indegree == n - 1

ðŸ”¸ Why n - 1?
as no of people = n and judge can be only 1 person, so n - 1 persons should trust him
